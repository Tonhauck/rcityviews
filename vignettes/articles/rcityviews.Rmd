## Introduction

Welcome to the tutorial page of the `rcityviews` package! The aim of this page
is to show you how you can use this package to create stylized images of the
world's cities. For this tutorial, I will focus on rendering one of my favorite
cities in the world: Amsterdam. Of course, feel free to adjust the code provided
here to create an image of any city of your choice.

First, allow me to shortly share the motivation behind the development of this
package. I like the look of printed city posters. For instance, I think they are
a nice present for a friend's birthday or to use as a decoration for my own
living space. However, the price tag and restricted options associated with
buying such posters online often dissuaded me from making a purchase.
Nevertheless, I wanted to have one depicting my hometown hanging on the wall in
my living room. Luckily, we are fortunate enough to live in a fascinating era
where open-source software can be used to accomplish almost anything. Thanks to
the incredible efforts made by the [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org)
contributors, a treasure trove of open geographical data is currently available,
enabling everybody to effectively make high-quality city posters in R. Maybe
even more important than that these posters cost no money, they are also
[free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

Before we start mapping, let's introduce the star of this tutorial. Amsterdam is
the capital and most populous city of the Netherlands and is well-known for its
canals, museums, bicycles, and coffee shops (not the ones that sell coffee). The
city is also incredibly diverse, with residents from over 180 different
nationalities living within its limits. With much variety in its urban and
natural features, Amsterdam makes for a pretty picture to look at from the sky.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap ="Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amsterdam_Satellite.jpg"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/Amsterdam.jpg")
```

## Mapping the City

To start mapping the city in R, you will first need to install the `rcityviews`
package (see the [home page](https://koenderks.github.io/rcityviews/) for
installation instructions) and load the package into your current R session.

```{r}
library("rcityviews")
```

The package contains a large internal database of cities names and coordinates
that you can access using the `list_cities()` function. Let's verify that the
city of Amsterdam is included in the internal database.

```{r}
list_cities(match = "Amsterdam")
```

As you can see, there are three entries in the internal database matched to the
name "Amsterdam". Since we want to make an image of Amsterdam in the Netherlands
(the first row of the output), we simply need to remember that the `name` of
this city is denoted as `Amsterdam` in the internal database. Once you have
matched the name of the city to its database entry, you can create an image of
the city by providing the city name as a string to the `cityview()` function.

Please be aware that rendering times in RStudio can be quite long for crowded
spatial images. You can avoid the render time entirely by specifying a file name
as input for the `filename` argument in the `cityview()` function. By doing so,
the image will be directly exported to your working directory in an appropriate
format. This is the recommended approach because it ensures that the image is
displayed properly at all times.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cityview(
  name = "Amsterdam",
  filename = "Amsterdam.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/Amsterdam.png")
```

The basic setup in the code block above is all you need to map any city in the
internal database. However, you can call the `cityview()` function with
additional arguments to style the image to your liking. For example, the `theme`
argument enables you to set the color scheme and font used in the image, while
the `border` argument enables you to set the type of border that surrounds the
city. You can find detailed documentation and examples of these arguments on
the [home page](https://koenderks.github.io/rcityviews/).

For instance, if you want the image to be rendered in a more minimalist style
and you want the the city to be surrounded by a circular border, you can use the
`cityview()` function with the additional arguments `theme = "original"` and
`border = "circle"`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cityview(
  name = "Amsterdam",
  border = "circle",
  theme = "original",
  filename = "Amsterdam2.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/Amsterdam2.png")
```

## Exploring the City

Now that you have learned how to create a city view of Amsterdam, let's explore
some specific districts within the city. Amsterdam is divided into seven main
residential districts (i.e., not including the harbor area "Havengebied"), each
with its own unique hotspots and features. You can use the various themes in the
package to create images of some of these districts and stylize them according
to what makes them unique.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap ="Source: https://amsterdam2050.nl/schalen/stadsdelen/"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamDistricts.png")
```

### The Center: Historic and Outgoing

First, let's explore the center of Amsterdam. This specific location is not
featured in the internal database, which means that you will need to create a
new city instance for it using the `new_city()` function.

```{r}
amsterdam <- list_cities("Amsterdam")[1, ]
# Create instance
center <- new_city(
  name = "Centrum, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = amsterdam[1, 4]
)
```

Instead of drawing a geometric border around this location, you can isolate the
center of Amsterdam by using the bounding box for the district as a border
(`border = "bbox"`) for the image. Using the `bbox` border is slightly different
from using any other border style, since it attempts to retrieve a border
polygon using the [Nominatim API](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html).
This means that it is crucial that the name given to `new_city()` matches an
entry in Nominatim. You can verify this by searching for your city in the API. 
For instance, Nominatim contains the center of Amsterdam as
[Centrum, Amsterdam](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html?q=centrum%2C+amsterdam),
which is why the `name` argument in the code above is specified as
`"Centrum, Amsterdam"`.

Next, you can use the created city instance as input for the `cityview()`
function, while also providing the argument `border = "bbox"`. This will render
the image of the center of Amsterdam using the bounding box for the district.
The center of Amsterdam is a historical and cultural hub, known for its canals,
architecture, and tourist attractions. This district offers a unique blend of
historic charm and modern energy. To capture its historical significance within
the city, I found the `vintage` theme suits the district best.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create image
cityview(
  name = center,
  border = "bbox",
  filename = "AmsterdamCenter.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamCenter.png")
```

### The East: Cultural Melting Pot

Let's expand the tour of Amsterdam to some of its other districts, like
Amsterdam-Oost. Oost is a district located in the eastern part of Amsterdam,
adjacent to the city center. It is well-known for its diverse neighborhoods,
trendy cafes and cultural hotspots, creating a cultural melting pot with a
lively atmosphere.

We can obtain the data for this district by creating a new city instance using
`Oost, Amsterdam`, which is available in the Nominatim API. Similar to before,
after you have created a new city instance using the `new_city()` function, you
can use the `cityview()` function with the `border = "bbox"` argument to render
the image using the bounding box for this district. Because Oost offers such a
diverse mix of cultural experiences, I found the `bright` theme to be most
fitting for the district.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create instance
east <- new_city(
  name = "Oost, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = amsterdam[1, 4]
)
# Create image
cityview(
  name = east,
  border = "bbox",
  theme = "bright",
  filename = "AmsterdamEast.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamEast.png")
```

### The South: Refined Elegance

Let's continue the tour of Amsterdam by visiting one of its other districts.
Amsterdam-Zuid is a highly sought-after district nestled in the southern part of
the city. This area is renowned for its beautiful architecture, featuring
elegant homes and inspiring museums. The southern part of Amsterdam also boasts
an abundance of beautiful parks, providing residents with ample green spaces to
enjoy.

By creating a new city instance for `Zuid, Amsterdam`, which is available in the
Nominatim API, you can obtain the necessary data for this district. You probably
know the drill by now, but you can use the `cityview()` function with the
`border = "bbox"` argument to render the image using the bounding box for this
district. Because Zuid is a quite upscale, I decided to render this image with
the `delftware` theme to add a touch of elegance and traditional Dutch flair.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create instance
south <- new_city(
  name = "Zuid, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = amsterdam[1, 4]
)
# Create image
cityview(
  name = south,
  border = "bbox",
  theme = "delftware",
  filename = "AmsterdamSouth.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamSouth.png")
```

### The West: Contemporary Cool

Let's move on to Amsterdam-West, the fourth district to visit. Situated between
two sprawling parks and in close proximity to the city center, this
once-working-class area has transformed into a hub of historic architecture,
trendy concept stores, and lively local bars where residents of all ages like to
spend their free time.

Since you arere already familiar with the process of creating a new city
instance using the Nominatim API, I won't go into the details again on how to do
this for `West, Amsterdam`. Due to its trendy vibes, I believe the `modern`
theme is a good fit for the district.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create instance
west <- new_city(
  name = "West, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = amsterdam[1, 4]
)
# Create image
cityview(
  name = west,
  border = "bbox",
  theme = "modern",
  filename = "AmsterdamWest.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamWest.png")
```

### The North: Artistic Hub

Finally, let's visit Amsterdam-Noord, a district situated across the IJ river to
the north of the city center. As a former shipyard area, Noord is gaining
prominence as an upcoming district, known for its creative energy and artistic
scene. This dynamic district presents a captivating blend of modern
architecture, fashionable waterfront cafes and vibrant cultural hubs. I found
the `comic` theme to be most fitting of the creative scene in this district, as
it gives the image a bit of a playful touch.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create instance
north <- new_city(
  name = "Noord, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = amsterdam[1, 4]
)
# Create image
cityview(
  name = north,
  border = "bbox",
  theme = "comic",
  filename = "AmsterdamNorth.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamNorth.png")
```

That wraps up the tour of Amsterdam in this tutorial. Two districts, namely
Nieuw-West and Zuidoost, have not been covered here. I encourage the interested
reader to explore and map these districts on their own.

## Concluding Comments

I hope you found this tutorial informative and inspiring to create your own 
personalized city maps using the `rcityviews` package. If you have created
something you're proud of, I would love to hear about it. Happy mapping!

This package is largely made possible by the invaluable contributions and
unwavering dedication of the OpenStreetMap contributors and the developers who
have made these data available to R users. Their tireless efforts continue to
improve the accessibility of open data for mapping worldwide. A heartfelt thank
