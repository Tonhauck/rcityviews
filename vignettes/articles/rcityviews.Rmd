## Introduction

Welcome to the tutorial page of the `rcityviews` package! The aim of this page
is to show you how you can use this package to create pretty images of the
world's cities. For this tutorial, I will focus on rendering one of my favorite
cities in the world: Amsterdam. Of course, feel free to adjust the code provided
in this tutorial to create an image of any city of your choice.

First, allow me to share the motivation behind the development of this package.
I like the look of printed city posters. For instance, I think they are a nice
present for a friend's birthday or to use as a decoration for your own living
space. However, the price tag and restricted options associated with buying such
posters online often dissuaded me from making a purchase. Nonetheless, I wanted
to have one depicting my hometown hanging on the wall in my living room.
Luckily, we are fortunate enough to live in a fascinating time where open-source
software can be used to accomplish almost anything. Thanks to the efforts made
by the [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) contributors, a treasure trove
of open geographical data is currently available, enabling everybody to
effectively make high-quality city posters in R. Maybe more important than that
these posters cost you no money, they are also
[free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

Before we start mapping, let's introduce the star of this tutorial. Amsterdam is
the capital and most populous city of the Netherlands and is well-known for its
canals, museums, bicycles, and coffee shops (not the ones that sell coffee). The
city is also incredibly diverse, with residents from over 180 different
nationalities living within the city limits. With so much variety in its urban
and natural features, Amsterdam makes for a pretty picture to look at from
the sky.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap ="Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amsterdam_Satellite.jpg"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/Amsterdam.jpg")
```

## Mapping the City

To start mapping the city, you first need to install the `rcityviews` package
(see the [home page](https://koenderks.github.io/rcityviews/) for installation
instructions) and load the package into your current R session.

```{r}
library("rcityviews")
```

The package contains a large internal database of cities that you can access
using the `list_cities()` function. Let's verify that Amsterdam is included in
the database.

```{r}
list_cities(match = "Amsterdam")
```

As you can see, there are three entries in the database matched to the string
"Amsterdam". Since we want to make an image of Amsterdam in the Netherlands (the
first row of the output), we simply need to remember that the `name` of this
city is denoted as `Amsterdam` in the database. Once you have matched the name
of the city to its database entry, you can create the image by providing the
city name directly to the `cityview()` function. 

Please be aware that rendering times in RStudio can be quite long for crowded
spatial images. You can avoid the render time entirely by specifying a file name
as input for the `filename` argument in the `cityview()` function. By doing so,
the image will be directly exported to your working directory in an appropriate
format. This is the recommended approach because it ensures that the image is
displayed properly at all times.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cityview(
  name = "Amsterdam",
  filename = "Amsterdam.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/Amsterdam.png")
```

This basic setup is all you need to map any city in the database. However, there
are more options to style the image to your liking. These options are accessible
using the additional arguments of the `cityview()` function. For example, the
`theme` argument enables you to set the color scheme and font used in the image,
while the `border` argument enables you to set the type of border that surrounds
the city. You can find detailed documentation and examples of these options on
the [home page](https://koenderks.github.io/rcityviews/).

For instance, if you want to change the default style to a more minimalist one,
and you want the the city to be surrounded by a circular border, you can use the
`cityview()` function with the additional arguments `theme = "original"` and
`border = "circle"`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cityview(
  name = "Amsterdam",
  border = "circle",
  theme = "original",
  filename = "Amsterdam2.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/Amsterdam2.png")
```

## Exploring Amsterdam

Now that you have learned how to create a city view of Amsterdam, let's explore
some specific districts within the city. Amsterdam is divided into seven
districts, each with its own unique hotspots and features. You can use the
various themes in the package to create images of some of these districts and
stylize them according to what makes them unique.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap ="Source: https://amsterdam2050.nl/schalen/stadsdelen/"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamDistricts.png")
```

### The Center: Historic and Outgoing

First, let's explore the center of Amsterdam. This location is not featured in
the internal database, which means that you will need to create a new city
instance for it using the `new_city()` function.

```{r}
amsterdam <- list_cities("Amsterdam")[1, ]
# Create instance
center <- new_city(
  name = "Centrum, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = amsterdam[1, 4]
)
```

You can isolate the center of Amsterdam by using the bounding box for the
district as a border (`border = "bbox"`) for the image. Using the `bbox`
border is slightly different from using the other border styles, since it
attempts to retrieve a border using the [Nominatim API](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html).
This means that it is crucial that the name given to `new_city()` matches an
entry in Nominatim. For instance, Nominatim contains the center of Amsterdam
as [Centrum, Amsterdam](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html?q=centrum%2C+amsterdam),
which is why the `name` argument in the code above is specified as
`"Centrum, Amsterdam"`.

Next, you can use the `center` city instance as input for the `cityview()`
function, while also providing the argument `border = "bbox"`. This will render
the image of the center of Amsterdam using the bounding box for the district.
The center of Amsterdam is a historical and cultural hub, known for its canals,
architecture, and tourist attractions. This district offers a unique blend of
historic charm and modern energy. To capture its historical significance within
the city, I found the `vintage` theme suits the district best.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create image
cityview(
  name = center,
  border = "bbox",
  filename = "AmsterdamCenter.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamCenter.png")
```

### The East: Cultural Melting Pot

Let's expand our tour to some of the other districts in Amsterdam, like
Amsterdam-Oost. Oost is a district located in the eastern part of Amsterdam,
adjacent to the city center. It is well-known for its diverse neighborhoods,
trendy cafes and cultural hot-spots, providing the charm of a cultural melting
pot with a lively atmosphere.

We can obtain the data for this district by creating a new city instance using
`Oost, Amsterdam`, which is matched to the Nominatim API. Similar to before,
after your have created a new city instance using the `new_city()` function, you
can use the `cityview()` function with the `border = "bbox"` argument to render
the image using the bounding box for this district. Because Oost offers such a
diverse mix of cultural experiences, I found the `bright` theme most fitting for
the district.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create instance
east <- new_city(
  name = "Oost, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = Amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = Amsterdam[1, 4]
)
# Create image
cityview(
  name = east,
  border = "bbox",
  theme = "bright",
  filename = "AmsterdamEast.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamEast.png")
```

### The South: Refined Elegance

We will continue our tour of Amsterdam by visiting another district.
Amsterdam-Zuid is a highly sought-after district nestled in the southern part of
the city. This area is renowned for its beautiful architecture, featuring
elegant homes and inspiring museums. The southern part of Amsterdam also boasts
an abundance of beautiful parks and iconic squares, providing residents with
ample green spaces to enjoy.

By creating a new city instance for `Zuid, Amsterdam`, matched to the Nominatim
API, you can obtain the necessary data for this district. You probably know the
drill by now, but you can use the `cityview()` function with the
`border = "bbox"` argument to render the image using the bounding box for this
district. Because Zuid is a quite upscale, I decided to render this image with
the `delftware` theme to add a touch of elegance to the image.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create instance
south <- new_city(
  name = "Zuid, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = Amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = Amsterdam[1, 4]
)
# Create image
cityview(
  name = south,
  border = "bbox",
  theme = "delftware",
  filename = "AmsterdamSouth.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamSouth.png")
```

### The West: Contemporary Cool

Let's explore Amsterdam-West, our fourth district. Situated between two
sprawling parks and in close proximity to the city center, this
once-working-class area has transformed into a hub of historic architecture,
trendy concept stores, and lively local bars where the residents like to spend
their free time.

Since you arere already familiar with the process of creating a new city
instance, I won't go into the details again on how to do this for
`West, Amsterdam`. Due to its trendy vibes, I believe the `modern` theme is a
perfect fit for this district.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create instance
west <- new_city(
  name = "West, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = Amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = Amsterdam[1, 4]
)
# Create image
cityview(
  name = west,
  border = "bbox",
  theme = "modern",
  filename = "AmsterdamWest.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamWest.png")
```

### The North: Artistic Hub

Finally, let's visit Amsterdam-Noord, a district situated across the IJ river,
north of the city center. Noord is gaining prominence as an upcoming district,
known for its creative energy and artistic scene. This dynamic district presents
a captivating blend of modern architecture, fashionable waterfront cafes and
vibrant cultural hubs. I found the `comic` theme to be most fitting of the
creative scene in this district, as it gives the image a bit of a playful touch.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create instance
north <- new_city(
  name = "Noord, Amsterdam",
  country = "The Netherlands",
  lat = Amsterdam[1, 3],
  long = Amsterdam[1, 4]
)
# Create image
cityview(
  name = north,
  border = "bbox",
  theme = "comic",
  filename = "AmsterdamNorth.png"
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/koenderks/rcityviews/raw/development/png/AmsterdamNorth.png")
```
